# SolidWorks Renders Portfolio

A curated gallery of CAD models I designed and rendered in **SOLIDWORKS** (some CATIA experience too).
This repo currently includes **renders only**; native CAD files will be added when my CAD environment is restored.

### Core skills shown across projects
- Solid modeling: Sketcher, Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft, Shell, Fillet/Chamfer, Patterns  
- Surface modeling: Boundary/Lofted surfaces, Fill surface, trims & blends  
- Assemblies & mates (biplane, pencil + sharpener)  
- Text/decals & materials (embossed text, decals)  
- Rendering: scenes, cameras, PhotoView settings

### 10) Raspberry Pi (Reference Model)
Quick reference model of a Raspberry Pi board to support a uni project prototype:
- Used to plan GPIO/sensor placement and mounting clearances in a planned train-safety prototype (MATLAB/Simulink logic driving a Pi; obstacle sensor input; emergency stop signal).
- Modeling the board helped define connector keep-outs, standoff height, and enclosure constraints.

## Notes
- File names are preserved as uploaded; spaces (`%20`) and ampersands (`%26`) are URL-encoded in links.
- Native CAD files (SLDPRT/SLDASM/SLDDRW) will be added later.
