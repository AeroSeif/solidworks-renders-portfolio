A gallery of CAD renders I modeled in SOLIDWORKS. Each project has images + notes; native CAD files will be added once my CAD environment is restored.

# SolidWorks Renders Portfolio
© Seif Adly. Renders for portfolio display only. Do not reuse without permission.

A curated gallery of CAD models I designed and rendered in **SOLIDWORKS** (with some CATIA experience).  
This repo currently includes **renders only**; native CAD files (`.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`, `.SLDDRW`) will be added when my CAD environment is restored.

**Core skills shown across projects**
- Solid modeling: Sketcher, Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft, Shell, Fillet/Chamfer, Patterns
- Surface modeling: Boundary/Lofted surfaces, Fill Surface, trims & blends (mouse & bottle)
- Assemblies & mates (biplane, pencil + sharpener)
- Text/decals & materials (embossed text, decals for Coca-Cola & Nissan, appearance tuning)
- Rendering: scenes, cameras, PhotoView settings

## Projects

### 1) Pencil & Sharpener
Reverse-engineered desk items to practice **multi-body parts**, **assembly mates**, and realistic materials.
- Tools: Sketch, Extrude, Fillet, Chamfer, Split line for paint strip, Assembly mates
- Detail: Embossed text “Property of Seif”

### 2) Curved Cosmetic Bottle
Freeform bottle for surface practice and presentation rendering.
- Tools: **Surface loft/boundary**, Knit, Shell, Fillet; appearance & scene tuning
- Focus: Continuous curvature and manufacturable wall thicknesses

### 3) Biplane (Double-Deck Wing) Concept
Display model to exercise assemblies, simple struts, and prop detail.
- Tools: Multi-body parts, Assemblies & mates, Circular patterns, Appearances
- Note: Visual/aesthetic model, not an aerodynamic study

### 4) Combination Wrench
Practice in ergonomic shaping, fillet transitions, and surface-to-solid workflows.
- Tools: Revolve, Sweeps, Variable fillets, Drafts, Surface trims for blend quality

### 5) Computer Mouse
Industrial-design style surface model with smooth curvature and split lines for color breaks.
- Tools: **Boundary/Lofted surfaces**, Fill surface, Split line, Shell, Fillets

### 6) Pipe Elbow + Flange (Sectioned)
Mechanical component model with a cutaway to show interior.
- Tools: Revolve, Extrude, Fillet, Shell, Cut-revolve, Patterns
- Focus: Interface geometry & gasket land

### 7) Nissan Key Fob
Reverse-engineered personal key fob with decal and textured materials.
- Tools: Surfacing + solids, Split line, Decal mapping, Appearances

### 8) Candle Holder (Decorative)
Parametric helix/loft concept focused on symmetry and render presentation.
- Tools: Helix/Spiral, Sweeps, Patterns, Appearances

![Candle Holder](candle-holder/Practice%20Model%20-%20Candle%20Holder.JPG)

---

### 9) Coca-Cola Bottle
Classic bottle profile with label decal and transparent material setup.
- Tools: Revolves, Shell, Fillets, **Decal mapping**, Optical material tuning

### 10) Raspberry Pi Board + Enclosure Concept
Part of my dissertation prototyping path on **railway safety**: concept system to detect track obstacles and stop a model train.
- **Concept**: Ultrasonic sensor feeds the **Raspberry Pi GPIO**; a Simulink controller (MATLAB/Simulink) evaluates distance and commands the motor driver (H-bridge) to cut traction when an obstacle is detected.  
- **Why an enclosure?** To mount the Pi securely to a testbed, manage cables, allow airflow, and protect from dust/vibration during lab tests. Standoffs, slots for USB/HDMI, and venting would be integrated for 3D printing.
- Tools shown in the model: Board layout approximation, Linear patterns (header pins), Appearances; enclosure shell to follow.

## Roadmap
- Add native CAD files (`.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`, `.SLDDRW`) using Git LFS
- Add engineering drawings (PDF) with GD&T callouts for select parts
- Add short write-ups on design-for-manufacture considerations

## Notes
When I regain access to SOLIDWORKS, I’ll upload the source models and drawings and link them here.
