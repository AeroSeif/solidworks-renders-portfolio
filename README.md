A gallery of CAD renders I modeled in SOLIDWORKS. Each project has images + notes; native CAD files will be added once my CAD environment is restored.

# SolidWorks Renders Portfolio
© Seif Adly. Renders for portfolio display only. Do not reuse without permission.

A curated gallery of CAD models I designed and rendered in **SOLIDWORKS** (with some CATIA experience).  
This repo currently includes **renders only**; native CAD files (`.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM`, `.SLDDRW`) will be added when my CAD environment is restored.

**Core skills shown across projects**
- Solid modeling: Sketcher, Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, Loft, Shell, Fillet/Chamfer, Patterns
- Surface modeling: Boundary/Lofted surfaces, Fill surface, trims & blends (mouse & bottle)
- Assemblies & mates (biplane, pencil + sharpener)
- Text/decals & materials (embossed text, decals for Coca-Cola & Nissan, appearance tuning)
- Rendering: scenes, cameras, PhotoView settings

## Projects

### 1) Pencil & Sharpener
Reverse-engineered desk items to practice **multi-body parts**, **assembly mates**, and realistic materials.
- Tools: Sketch, Extrude, Fillet, Chamfer, Split line for paint strip, Assembly mates
- Detail: Embossed text “Property of Seif”

### 2) Curved Cosmetic Bottle
Freeform bottle for surface practice and presentation rendering.
- Tools: **Surface loft/boundary**, Knit, Shell, Fillet; appearance & scene tuning
- Focus: Continuous curvature and manufacturable wall thicknesses

### 3) Biplane (Double-Deck Wing) Concept
Display model to exercise assemblies, simple struts, and prop detail.
- Tools: Multi-body parts, Assemblies & mates, Circular patterns, Appearances
- Note: Visual/aesthetic model, not an aerodynamic study
